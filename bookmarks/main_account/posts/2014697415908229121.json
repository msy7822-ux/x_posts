  "text": "Manthan Gupta Agentic System Patterns That Increased Accuracy by 50% (And What They Cost) 11K \"Agentic systems are already being deployed for complex tasks: building software, conducting research, analyzing data, and automating workflows. But as they move from prototypes to production, teams face a fundamental question: how do you build an agentic system that reliably handles any task? The answer isn’t just about better prompts or more sophisticated models. It’s about understanding the trade-offs between three critical dimensions:\" \"The truth is that most techniques that improve accuracy also increase cost and latency. Multi-step reasoning, parallel verification, and self-correction loops. They all make your system better, but at a price. The key is knowing when to pay that price and how to optimize within your constraints. This blog distills lessons learned from building agentic systems in production. Each tip includes concrete impact metrics on cost, latency, and accuracy, along with guidance on when to apply it. By the end, you will have a framework for making informed decisions about your agentic system architecture. Note: I was inspired to write this after recently using\" for several coding tasks. Observing how their autonomous agent handled planning, execution, and self-correction, a now common pattern in agentic systems, made me want to document the underlying patterns that make agentic systems work in production. Let’s get into it. Every decision you m",
