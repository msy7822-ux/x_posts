You do not need to do anything to migrate to this and it should not disrupt any of your existing workflows. You can invoke any skill with the slash command syntax by starting with `/`. Similarly, every slash command you currently have can be called as a Skill by Claude Code. Additionally, you can use subagents with Skills seamlessly.\" Slash Commands were one of our first abstractions for managing context, and served as a form of progressive disclosure. You could make sure the model only loaded this context when needed. But as model capabilities have advanced, we realized Skills were the more powerful way of loading context. They allow the model to load in context dynamically by reading relevant files and you could reference other files inside of your which would allow for multiple levels of dynamic context. We call this progressive disclosure and you can read more about how this works with \". Combining skills & slash makes it easier for Claude (e.g. it doesn’t need a SlashCommand Tool and a Skill Tool) and it also simplifies the user mental model. However, there is no migration needed. Your slash commands in ~/.claude/commands will continue to work as normal. Going forward, when thinking of making a slash command we suggest making a skill instead. This will allow you to use new extensions we add to Skills, such as the ones to work with subagents. For each skill you create, you can choose whether you want it to be invocable, model-invocable, o",
