  "text": "DC How I made $75,000 overnight 86K \"$75,000 hit my bank account at 3am while I was asleep Woke up and thought my phone was glitching It wasn't. And I didn't do anything satisfactory Why? I know how to broker Oil. Here's how I got paid to sleep: The setup: Seller: Trading house in Singapore (GMT+8) Buyer: Fuel distributor in Lagos (GMT+1) Me: Based in EST (GMT-5) I'd verified both parties over 6 weeks. Seller had product. Buyer had payment capability. Deal was ready to execute The final steps: Buyer's bank in Lagos issued the LC at 4pm their time (10am my time) LC needed to be confirmed by seller's bank in Singapore Singapore bank opens at 9am their time = 8pm my time I got on a call at 8pm EST to help push documents through By 11pm my time, everything was submitted. Singapore bank said confirmation would come \\\"within hours\\\" I went to sleep at midnight Woke up at 7am to: - LC confirmed - Product title transferred - Payment initiated - MT103 wire confirmation in my inbox - Commission processing The Singapore bank had confirmed at 3am my time The title transfer happened at 5am my time I was unconscious for all of it $75,000. While sleeping. \\\"That's not fair\\\" Nobody said it was fair. I said it works Here's what most people don't understand: Oil trades 24/7 across every time zone Singapore. Rotterdam. Houston. Dubai. Lagos. London When you build relationships across multiple time zones, deals progress while you sleep The work I did: - 6 weeks verifying both parties - 15+ calls coordinating the transaction - 4 days pushing documents through banks The work I didn't do: - Wake up at 3am to watch a bank confirm an LC - Manually process the title transfer - Babysit the wire The deal closed itself because I'd done the work upfront By the time I went to sleep, every party was verified, every document was submitted, every next step was automatic I didn't get paid to sleep I got paid for 6 weeks of work that allowed me",
