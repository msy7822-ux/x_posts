Whether it will be meditation, cold showers, or morning walks. The list goes on. However, there is one simple, daily habit that I believe is the most transformative. And I haven't heard anyone speak about it. And it's this: Keep a list of every time you proved the voice in your head wrong and went against it.

Firstly, you start to realize you're not the voice in your head, you're just the one who observes. Something that takes years of meditation to realize. Secondly, you start to realize the inner voice/critic in your head is just your limiting beliefs. And by doing this list every day, you start to look for ways to break these patterns and continuously try to prove them wrong, and as you do that, you have a direct correlation of achieving your goals and having a better life. Give it a go. The compounding effect is real.",
