So it can debug my code, automate tasks, take screenshots, run tests, and more. The question is, how? There's a surprising number of approaches to consider including MCP, CLI, browser extensions, skills, or IDEs. Here are 10 ways to integrate your LLM with a browser, grouped by approach:\" – Cross-browser testing tool. Slow. Each action is a round trip. – Adapted from Playwright MCP. Automates user’s browser to support logged-in sessions and avoids bot detection. – Useful for perf analysis / network debugging – Good for quick logged-in checks. Less dependencies than MCP and faster. – Mixes Playwright MCP with Chrome extension benefits. Works for any agent.",
